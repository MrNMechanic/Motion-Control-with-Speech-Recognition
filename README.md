# Motion-Control-with-Speech-Recognition
Servo Motion Control using only Adruino and Python (No Shields or other peripherals)

# Requirements
Speech Recognition Library , PySerial Library)

# Simple Explanation
I have a 120 degrees servo motor so i've added three commands.
command 1 = 0 degrees --------- (by saying 'one')
command 2 = 60 degrees --------- (by saying 'two')
command 3 = 120 degrees --------- (by saying 'three')
These are absolutes coordinates.
It is just another example of how we can use Speech Recognition to control e.g a Robot Arm
